To interpret user needs and implement them into a program, it's important to engage with users, understand their goals, and translate those into actionable requirements. Creating "user stories" helps by breaking down user needs into simple, digestible tasks that focus on the user's perspective, making it easier to prioritize and develop features that directly address those needs. When developing programs, I plan to incorporate Agile processes like iterative development, continuous feedback, and regular stand-ups to ensure flexibility and alignment with user goals. Being a good team member in software development means collaborating effectively, communicating openly, and being adaptable to feedback and change, all while contributing to the shared goals of the team.
